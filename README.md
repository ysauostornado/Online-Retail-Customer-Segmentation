# Customer Campaign Performance Analysis

📊 **University Data Analytics Project** analyzing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using customer demographics, transaction history, and offer engagement data.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project investigates **which campaign offers drive the highest engagement and revenue** across different customer segments.  
By combining transaction, demographic, and campaign data, we identify **actionable recommendations** for optimizing marketing campaigns.

---

## 📂 Datasets
- `events.csv` – customer actions (transactions, offers received/viewed/completed)  
- `offers.csv` – metadata (offer type, duration, reward, difficulty)  
- `customers.csv` – demographics (age, gender, income, membership date)  
- `data/final_events_with_customers.csv` – cleaned & merged dataset (272K+ rows, 14,825 valid customers)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)** – data cleaning & analysis  
- **Excel** – quick cleaning & validation  
- **Tableau** (optional) – visualization  

**Data Cleaning**  
- Removed ~2,000 invalid customers (e.g., unrealistic ages, missing income/gender)  
- Merged events, offers, and customers datasets into one analysis-ready file  

**Analysis Focus**  
- Offer completion rates (Discount vs. BOGO, Gender differences)  
- Customer segmentation by age and income  
- Engagement trends over campaign timeline
